# Sales-Trend-Forecasting-with-Time-Series-Analysis

## Overview

This data science project focuses on time series forecasting for sales data. The project aims to create a model that can predict future sales based on past data. The project is implemented using Python programming language and some of the most popular data science and machine learning libraries.

## Data Source

The data used in this project is a time series sales data, which can be found in the "sales_data.csv" file. The dataset contains daily sales data for a period of five years.

## Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict future sales based on historical sales data. To achieve this goal, the following tasks will be performed:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning to prepare the data for modeling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data
- Creation of a time series forecasting model using different techniques
- Evaluation of the performance of the model
- Visualization of the results

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and libraries will be used in this project:

- Python programming language
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib

## Files Included

The project contains the following files:

- `sales_data.csv`: This file contains the raw sales data used in the project.
- `timeSeries_forecasting_model.ipynb`: This is a Jupyter Notebook file that contains the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model creation and evaluation, and result visualization. The file is structured in a way that makes it easy to follow and reproduce the results.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of data science and machine learning techniques for time series forecasting of sales data. The project code and methodology can be used as a starting point for more complex time series forecasting tasks in the retail industry.
